Prints the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two numbers
by David Baylor on 7/3/19
using python 3.0

What is best to put in the docstring in the heading? In the first chapter of the book it said to include the mane of the
program, what the program does, the name of the programmer, and the date it was written. In the first assignment though
it said to put the dependencies of the program and what the code does in the heading. Could you provide some
clarification as to what to put in the heading? thank you

num1 = 2  # defines num1 and num2
num2 = 5

print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", num1 + num2)  # prints the sum of num1 and num2

print("The difference between", num1, "and", num2, "is", num1 - num2)  # prints the difference between num1 and num2

print("The product of", num1, "and", num2, "is", num1 * num2)  # prints the product of num1 and num2

print("The quotient of", num1, "and", num2, "is", num1 / num2)  # prints the quotient of num1 and num2
